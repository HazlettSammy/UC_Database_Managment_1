In Database Managment 1, we explored the fundamentals of Structured Query Language (SQL) and relational database management. The course focused on designing, querying, and manipulating databases, covering essential topics such as creating tables, defining relationships with primary and foreign keys, and maintaining data integrity with constraints. We learned to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data using SQL commands, along with advanced techniques like joins, subqueries, and aggregations. Through practical exercises, we gained a strong foundation in building and managing efficient, well-structured databases.
